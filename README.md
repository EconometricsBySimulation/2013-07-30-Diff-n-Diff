Code snippet from blog - Stata

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is generally the practice of estimating latent factor(s) from observable measures.  It is similar to factor analysis in that it typically reduces a problem with potentially many dependent variables to a lower dimension which we hope is interpretable.

Letâ€™s imagine a relatively simple model where this might be useful.  We have five responses which are measures of 2 latent traits we are interested in.  For half of our sample we administer an intervention with the hopes that it will increase our latent traits.  We administer a pretest measuring the 5 observables before the treatment and a posttest after measuring the 5 observables after.
